The goal is to predict the product ratings given the other features known for a product on Wish.com. 
Ratings are in categories from 1 to 5. For one product, the higher the rating is, the more the customers like the product. 
In this way, when you have a new product to be put on wish.com, you can estimate how likely people will like your product, without actually listing out there. 
Also, by doing this, it helps us to understand under what certain conditions that a product will be highly rated, as a way to understand the customer base of the wish.com.
